# peteSpace

peteSpace is a Twitter-like application created using Vue.js, Flask, and SQLite. Created during the Wednesday workshop, _Backend Programming_.

The intention is for you to fork or clone this repository and create a backend application using Flask that connects with the already complete Vue.js client.

## Usage

Ensure that `node`, `yarn`, and `python3` are installed.

First, install the dependencies for the client app:
```
cd client/
yarn install
```

You can then start a development server to see what the frontend looks like:
```
cd client/
yarn serve
```
Details for how to run the API backend will be included on the `finished` branch.
