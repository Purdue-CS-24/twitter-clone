# Backend Programming

# Summary

In this session, we will integrate everything we have learned so far to create a complete web application. In order to store user data, we will first learn the Structured Query Language (SQL) in order to interface with a database. We'll also go over what a relational database is and the best practices when using one. We will use a pre-built Vue.js frontend application and add functionality to it by using Flask. By the end of the workshop, we will have built a basic Twitter clone.

# Prerequisites

1. Install all of the prerequisites from the [Intro to Web Programming](https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Web-Programming-beec0b0f708746abac3fc712ba033853) and [Single-Page Applications](https://www.notion.so/Single-Page-Applications-d15d1083b24042b39b45f54f32def065) workshops
2. Ensure `sqlite3` is installed on your system
